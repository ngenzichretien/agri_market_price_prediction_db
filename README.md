## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **Oracle PL/SQL-based intelligent system** that analyzes **historical agricultural market prices and production data** to **predict future crop prices**.  
It helps **farmers, cooperatives, and government agencies** make **data-driven decisions** on:

- Which crops to plant  
- When to sell  
- How to maximize profit  
- How to detect dangerous price drops  

The system combines:
- ✅ Oracle Database  
- ✅ PL/SQL Procedures, Functions, Cursors & Packages  
- ✅ Triggers & Auditing  
- ✅ Business Intelligence (BI) concepts

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Farmers suffer from unpredictable crop prices due to the absence of reliable forecasting tools and historical data analysis systems. This causes poor planning, financial instability, and loss of profit. This project solves that problem by using **PL/SQL-based analytics and prediction models inside Oracle Database**.
